# NBA Players career duration prediction using Naive Bayes Model

## Introduction

In this project, a Naive Bayes model has been implemented. Naive Bayes models can be valuable to use any time you are doing work with predictions because they give you a way to account for new information. In today's world, where data is constantly evolving, modeling with Naive Bayes can help you adapt quickly and make more accurate predictions about what could occur.

For this project, we provide provides insights for management and coaches in the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional basketball league in North America. The league is interested in retaining players who can last in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time.

The data for this project consists of performance statistics from each player's rookie year. There are 1,341 observations, and each observation in the data represents a different player in the NBA. Your target variable is a Boolean value that indicates whether a given player will last in the league for five years. We will first perform the appriopriate data cleaning and feature engineering procedures on the available dataset to make it ready for modelling and the we'll construct the Naive bayes prediction model with appropriate parameters

This project was performed as a part of Google advanced data analysis program. The dataset used for this project has been made available in CSV format
